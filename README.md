## 🏢 ERP Console (Web Dashboard)

A unified, high-performance web dashboard merging the ZKTeco Biometric Attendance System with an IT Helpdesk and AD Console. Built entirely with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no build step required.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c291473-75cd-4f0a-b634-afcc75cbdc84">

### Overview

The ERP Console connects to two primary backends:
1. **ZKTeco Local Server** — Python/Flask API (v2.2) handling local biometric hardware, SQLite employee databases, attendance logs, messaging, ticketing, and all admin functions.
2. **Google Apps Script (GAS)** — Cloud backend managing IT Helpdesk tickets, token queues, Drive storage, and GAS-side authentication.

It features full PWA support, offline punch caching via IndexedDB, four UI themes, and a built-in suite of IT networking and utility tools.

### 🎮 Demo Mode

Don't have the backends set up yet? Click **"🎮 Enter Demo Mode"** on the login screen to explore the full UI with mock employees, tickets, devices, and attendance data — no server required.

---

### 🔒 Security Notes

- All API routes are protected by `@login_required` or `@admin_required` decorators; the frontend RBAC only controls UI visibility.
- Passwords are stored as salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashes — never in plain text.
- Sessions are tracked server-side and can be revoked instantly by an admin.
- The audit log records every sensitive action for accountability.
